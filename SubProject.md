[^1]: Karatime from [1234] and usual subs from [Davinci] for better translation. Might reconsider since [1234] uses better formatting of subs, possible to use [1234] as default and changes the lines to [Davinci]
[^2]: Resubbing from (ind) or find another fansub
[^3]: Remuxing EN subs and recheck if subs are compatible, also remove the incomplete subs note
